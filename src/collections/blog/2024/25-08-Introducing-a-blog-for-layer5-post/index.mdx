This article introduces a hands-on Learning path for application architects and developers
launched by the Layer5 Community. This learning route assumes you have some
background knowledge of cloud, microservices, containers, and Docker. Since cloud-native
apps built on microservices are the main topic of this entire course, within these learning
paths are a collection of carefully curated training resources to help you advance your
general understanding of cloud-native networking and your service mesh-specific skills.
</p>

<p>
The Learning Path is an initiative developed to help enlighten and test your knowledge on
service meshes and management of the workloads that you’ll build atop of them. As a light
Learning Management System, Layer5 Learning Paths offer cloud-native training and
certification through the lens of role-based paths with interactive labs intertwined through
the chapters. It comprises courses that are hand-curated by the maintainers at Layer5 to
equip you with the foundational tools like <Link to=”/meshery”>Meshery</Link> that assists
you in comprehending service mesh concepts.
</p>

###Learning Path Options

<p>
Depending on your role as a developer, operator, or security engineer, you can choose the
learning path most relevant to your everyday focus. This learning path currently has two
focus areas for you to explore.
</p>

<ul>
<li><img src={Service} alt="Mastering Service Mesh for Developers" width="55%" height="55%" />
This introductory course in the Learning Path focuses on Developers and what they
need to know to successfully design workloads for a service mesh environment.</li>

<li><img src={Service} alt="Mastering Service Mesh for Developers" width="55%" height="55%" />
This advanced learning path teaches you how to set up a service mesh and control
its workloads. However, this course is still in development.</li>

<p>The Layer5 community believes that the growth of an individual user and contributor will
impact the community’s development. Hence, these courses are all carefully selected to
help you learn service mesh the right way from experts on Service Meshes in Layer5. This
Learning Path/Certification course, in addition to the available mesh training resources, is
designed to take a developer from a novice in service mesh to an advanced Service Mesh
Practitioner.</p>

##Learning Paths Information & Architecture

<img src={Arch} alt="Learning Paths Information & Architecture" width="55%" height="55%" />

<p>This learning path / Certification project is still in its earliest phases, and so currently, only
one learning path is currently available: Mastering Service Meshes For Developers.
It comprises two courses in length; an introduction to Service Meshes and an introduction
to the advanced concepts of Service Meshes, with ~8 chapters per course. The courses in
this learning path focus on the fundamentals of Service Meshes and use Meshery as the
management plane in managing the service meshes. You will discover eight to nine
streamlined chapters in each course that will assist developers with installing Meshery,
deploying apps, and maintaining service meshes using Meshery.</p>

## Service Mesh Supported 
<p>This learning path supports two outstanding service meshes, Istio and Linkerd. Users can
choose the service mesh they want to study in each learning path. You can learn the
principles of several service meshes independently by clicking a button.</p>

##What will I learn in this course?
<p>The learning path contains a range of topics from the basics to advanced topics on services
meshes and the role Meshery plays as a cloud-native management plane.
By the end of this learning path, you will have the knowledge and confidence on how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploy an application using service meshes(Istio & Linkerd).</li>
<li>Expose services using ingress gateway for different service meshes.</li>
<li>Understand how service mesh performance is used to measure for Observability in
your system.</li>
<li>With Routing and canary, you will get your hands on some of the traffic
management capabilities for different service meshes.</li>
<li>You will discover how to use systematic defects to assess an application's resilience.</li>
<li>You will gain insight on topics like, fault injection, circuit breaking, mutual Tls and
more.</li>
<li>You will learn more about Service security capabilities and how that work.</li>
<li>Experience huge performance improvements using Webassembly and intelligent
data planes.</li>

</ul>
<p>This course is for you if…</p>

<ul>
<li>...you want to gain a clear and advanced understanding of Service Meshes.</li>
<li>... you have been trying to learn and understand service mesh but still don't
understand.</li>
<li> …you are an application architect or developer.</li>
<li>…you already understand service meshes and are looking for a course to cover
advanced topics. This learning path also includes expert topics!</li>
</ul>

##What’s next?

<p>The upcoming phases of this learning Path/certification will focus on capturing users’ data
to help track progress on each learning path. Multiple learning paths, interactive labs, and
quizzes will test participants' knowledge and award them a certificate upon completion of a
learning path. Maintainers and contributors are working towards implementing some of
these features in future releases. Some of the core features to expect:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Multiple Learning Paths.</li>
 <li>User Account</li>
 <li>Bookmarking / Progression tracking</li>
 <li>Quizzes and grades</li>
 <li>Certificate of Completion</li>

</ul>

##Conclusion
<p>Layer5 is a creator and maintainer of service mesh standards and this makes it the best
place for you to gain this knowledge. One of our fantastic initiatives is the interactive
practice labs, which let you study while you explore services meshes on your browser. As
the primary developers of the cloud native management plane, Meshery, our maintainers
are readily available to answer your questions, should you in-case you have any.
The Learning paths are now available on the Layer5 site. Feel free to take these courses
and try out the hands-on tutorials. </p>
